* Calva

Hugo theme used by https://juanwolf.fr or at least will when I am sober. The aim is to have a fully functionnal theme without any use of JavaScript.

** How to use
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/juanwolf/calva
   #+END_SRC

   In your website config file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC yaml

   #+END_SRC
